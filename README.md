You know Python, Data Analysis, Visualization, Model training, and Tuning. You are developing your ML knowledge day by day. Very good!

But you can't show it to the world. How would it establish your knowledge? I am here to guide you through an End-to-end project (in Bangla) where you will learn how to setup your projects, how to write codes, what the project structure should look like, how to make a web app with Flask, and lastly, how to deploy it on the cloud with AWS!

Here goes the first session on Project Setup & Structure, EDA, and Data Ingestion. Keep an eye on the next videos too. Trust me, you will be able to work on any ML Project in a professional way you never did before.

Though the [BOOTCAMP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8fwLZ3a6azf4oVffUWpS8-5sTInZfMhu) is paid, these 4 special classes of the end-to-end project remain public. Link to the classes:
1. [Class 40. End-to-End Project: Setup, Project Structure, GitHub, EDA, Ingestion.](https://youtu.be/FAL13AxdIIs)
2. [Class 41. End-to-End Project: Data Transformation, Model Training & Evaluation.](https://youtu.be/g2RjfcEEVBM)
3. [Class 42. End-to-End Project: Parameter Tuning, Flask Web App.](https://youtu.be/eVvbI41amVs)
4. [Class 42. Deployment in the AWS Cloud with CI/CD Pipelines.]()
